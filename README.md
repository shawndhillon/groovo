# 🎶 GROOVO

A social platform for music fans to log albums, share reviews, and discover new music.

---

## 🛑 Problem Statement
In today’s app ecosystem, there’s no centralized platform dedicated to music discussion and discovery.  
Conversations are scattered across **Reddit**, **YouTube**, **Last.fm**, and **TikTok** — making it hard to find and share thoughtful perspectives on music.  

This app fills that gap by creating a **community-driven space** for reviews, ratings, and discovery.
